 * @brief The lock_guards class
 * lock_guards is a mutexes wrapper that provides a convenient RAII-style mechanism for owning a mutexes for the duration of a scoped block.
 * lock_guards use a deadlock avoidance algorithm to avoid deadlock.
 * Example:

   std::mutex m1;
   std::recursive_mutex m2;

   void do_work()
   {
      auto guards = std_ext::make_locks(m1, m2);
      //do rest of work
